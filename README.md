You can use JSNAPy to automate verifications on Junos devices (operational state verifications and configuration verifications).        
JSNAPy is supported in three modes:
 - a command line tool
 - a Python module
 - An ansible module hosted on the Ansible Galaxy website
 
You will find at the root of the repository a [JSNAPy presentation](JSNAPy_presentation.pdf)  

This repo has ready to use JSNAPy content.  
Please visit [wiki](https://github.com/ksator/junos-verifications-automation-with-jsnapy/wiki) for the instructions.
